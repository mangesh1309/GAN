# GAN Implementation using TensorFlow

This repository contains two implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow. The implementations are designed to generate synthetic data using two different datasets:

1. `mnist_gan`: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits images.
2. `fashion_gan_final`: Uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset, containing images of fashion items such as clothing and accessories.

## Files

1. `mnist_gan.py`: Implementation of GAN using TensorFlow for generating synthetic handwritten digits images.
2. `fashion_gan_final.py`: Implementation of GAN using TensorFlow for generating synthetic fashion item images.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently to train and generate synthetic data using the respective dataset. Make sure to have TensorFlow installed along with any necessary dependencies mentioned in the code files.
